    "A recommendation engine is software that analyzes available data to make suggestions for something that a website user might be interested in, such as a book, a video or a job, among other possibilities. Netflix, for example, uses metadata tagging on videos in conjunction with data about user behavior to come up with recommended movies and TV shows for specific members. Through this project, I have attempted to create a Recommendation Engine using the Collaborative filtering model to predict what movies an existing user as well as a new user would want to watch."

For instance when we are recommending the same kind of item like a movie recommendation or song recommendation. \n",

Further, there are 2 types of collaborative filtering algorithms:\n",

This algorithm is far less resource consuming than user-user collaborative filtering. \n",
